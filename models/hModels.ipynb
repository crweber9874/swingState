Below I load the data and estimate a simple Bayesian multilevel model. The model is a multinomial logit. The dependent variable is three point party identification. We can always change this to something with more categories, but the survey questions vary somewhat, so three categories seems reasonable. The intercepts vary across years and states. This should eventually be expanding to include survey organization (ANES, NAES, CCES, VSG) The model is estimated using the `brms` package in R. It's pretty slow, so I use variational bayes. It then takes about 14 minutes.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n","\\begin{align}\n","pr(y_i = k) &\\sim \\text{Multinomial}(\\alpha_{Year} + \\alpha_{State}) \\\\\n","\\alpha_{Year} &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\sigma_{Year}) \\\\\n","\\alpha_{State} &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\sigma_{State}) \\\\\n","\\alpha_{org} &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\sigma_{State}) \\\\\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","I use the default priors.
